# Wildlife-tracker

## Phase 1: Setup & Data Collection
1. **Environment setup**
   - Install Python, required libraries and GPU drivers
   - Configure development environment with YOLOv9

2. **Data acquisition**
   - Gather comprehensive animal dataset
   - Source camera trap images from multiple biomes
   - Include images from existing wildlife datasets (iNaturalist, COCO, etc.)

3. **Camera trap deployment**
   - Select strategic locations
   - Configure camera settings (motion detection, time intervals)
   - Ensure proper GPS tagging and timestamp recording

## Phase 2: Model Development
1. **Dataset preparation**
   - Label and annotate images with bounding boxes
   - Create comprehensive animal taxonomy classification system
   - Split dataset into training/validation/test sets

2. **Model training**
   - Use transfer learning with pre-trained YOLOv9
   - Fine-tune on global wildlife dataset (all terrestrial animals)
   - Implement data augmentation to handle various environments

3. **Model optimization**
   - Evaluate performance metrics
   - Optimize for edge deployment if needed
   - Validate with test images from various environments

## Phase 3: Application Development
1. **Processing pipeline**
   - Develop automated image processing workflow
   - Implement species identification algorithm
   - Extract metadata (location, time, date)

2. **Database creation**
   - Design schema for animal sightings
   - Implement geospatial database
   - Create data management system

3. **Mapping interface**
   - Develop interactive mapping system
   - Create species distribution visualizations
   - Implement temporal analysis tools

## Phase 4: Deployment & Analysis
1. **System deployment**
   - Install processing software on target hardware
   - Configure automated processing workflow
   - Implement data upload/sync mechanism

2. **Analysis tools**
   - Create dashboard for wildlife presence patterns
   - Develop temporal analysis for migration tracking
   - Implement species density mapping

3. **Reporting system**
   - Generate automated reports
   - Create visualization tools for findings
   - Implement sharing mechanisms for research

## Phase 5: Maintenance & Expansion
1. **Model updating**
   - Periodically retrain with new data
   - Improve species identification accuracy
   - Expand taxonomy as needed

2. **System scaling**
   - Add additional camera locations
   - Expand geographical coverage
   - Implement citizen science contributions

3. **Research integration**
   - Connect with conservation initiatives
   - Share data with scientific community
   - Integrate with other wildlife monitoring systems

This comprehensive approach ensures your "WildlifeTracker" project can identify and map any animal species captured by your camera traps.
